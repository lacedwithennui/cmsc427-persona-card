            <p class="bio">Marcus is a 25-year-old college graduate. He made a few mistakes with his credit during college,
                which tanked his score.</p>

                        <li>Some credit apps show a 'useless' VantageScore score instead of FICO: "<span class="quote">I
                                heard the score on Credit Karma isn't the 'real' one banks use for mortgages."</span></li>
                        <li>Pre-approval tools for credit cards often negatively affect credit score: "<span class="quote">I
                                look for cards with 'pre-approval' tools that don't hurt my score. I won't apply unless I'm
                                90% sure I'll get it."</span></li>
                        <li>Personal finance education in public schools is outdated: "<span class="quote">They taught us
                                how to write checks. They didn't teach us about predatory lending or how credit utilization
                                works. I learned the hard way."</span></li>
